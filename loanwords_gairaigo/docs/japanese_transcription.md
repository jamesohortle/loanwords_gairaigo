# Transcription for Japanese

We follow the [_Nihon-shiki_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon-shiki_romanization) method for transcribing Japanese _kana_ into Roman letters since it is a one-to-one representation. However, we make some important modifications.

## Modifications

- Separating syllables: we use spaces to separate symbols corresponding to single _kana_ or _kana_ and _sokuon_(ッ)/_yôon_(ャ, ュ, ョ). _I.e._, カタカナ → `ka ta ka na`.
- Long vowels: are indicated by writing the corresponding mora instead of a circumflex. _I.e._, ちょうおん → tyôon → `tyo u o N` (we use the transcription for the _kana_ that would be used in Japanese). For _katakana_ words with a [prolonged sound mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%8Donpu), we use a hyphen: ラーメン →`ra - me N`.
- Nasal mora: the Japanese ん/ン is written as `N` (a capital letter n) instead of using apostrophes.
- Geminate consonants: can be indicated by an `x` (しまった → `si ma x ta`) since it is always represented by a small っ/ッ in Japanese orthography. If using `x`, treat it as a separate _kana_ and surround with spaces.
- Bilabial fricative: the English f sound is most faithfully reproduced by Japanese ふ/フ, so we introduce `f` to represent フ followed by a small vowel (ァ, ィ, ェ, ォ).
- We introduce `np` and `ts` to represent the nasal mora ン followed by a パ, ピ, プ, ペ or ポ and ツ followed by ァ, ィ, ェ or ォ, respectively.
- We introduce `v` to represent a lack of vowel, _i.e._, only the initial consonant. This is later mapped to ウ (or sometimes イ). _E.g._, bump → `ba npv` → バンプ.
